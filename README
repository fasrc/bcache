bcache -- caching versions of LSF's bjobs and bhist

See `bcache --help' for more information.  The output of that is reproduced 
below, but may be out of date.

This is the case study that prompted the development of this, and at the bottom 
there are plots showing the increased performance.

NAME
    bjobsc/bhistc - caching versions of LSF's bjobs and bhist

SYNOPSIS
    bjobsc [OPTIONS --] [BJOBS_OPTIONS_AND_ARGS]
    bhistc [OPTIONS --] [BHIST_OPTIONS_AND_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
    This same script is used for caching of both bjobs and bhist.  Symlink to 
    it as anything with `bjobs' or `bhist' in the named, respectively, 
    including simply `bjobs' or `bhist' (in that case put its parent 
    directory in the PATH before LSF's bin directory).

    If this is called with BJOBS_OPTIONS_AND_ARGS/BHIST_OPTIONS_AND_ARGS being 
    one JOBID, it tries to construct a response from previously saved output of 
    `bjobs/bhist -a'.  If the cache is not present or has expired this attempts
    to build it (unless --do-not-update-cache is specified).  Otherwise, or if 
    anything else goes wrong, this falls back to running the actual bjobs/bhist 
    command.  Furthermore, if the given JOBID is greater than any jobid in the 
    cache, it falls back to running the actual command.

    When producing an answer from cache, this attempts to properly reproduce 
    stdout, stderr, and exit status so that it's indistinguishable from 
    non-cached output.  Furthermore, since this script execs the actual command 
    in any cases it can't handle, it's meant as a drop-in replacement for the 
    bjobs or bhist command -- no command line changes required.

    Note that both this command and bjobs/bhist may require options.  All 
    options to this command must be specified first and end with the special 
    separator --.  Note that getopt is *not* used to parse this command's 
    options (and, e.g. --long-opt=OPTARG will not work).

OPTIONS
    --cache-dir DIRECTORY
        Directory to store cache (and lock, temporary, etc.) files.  Default is 
        /tmp.
    
    --lifetime SECONDS
        Cache validity lifetime.  Default is 600 (as of writing).
    
    --do-not-update-cache
        If the cache has expired, attempt to refresh it.  Default is to not do 
        this.  This uses locks and temp files to make this go as smoothly as 
        possible in an environment when this is called heavily and 
        asynchronously.

    --extra-args ARGS
        Extra args to add to the bjobs or bhist command when making the cache.  
        E.g., `-u USERNAME' if this will be used for anybody but the calling 
        user.  These are not added when caching fails and the given command is 
        run as-is.
    
    --debug
        Print extra diagnostic messages to stderr.

    -h, --help
        Print this help.
